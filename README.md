# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis:

For this project, we teamed up with Omar to create a summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data and by the type of city (i.e urban, rural). We'll be making mulitple line graphs the help stakeholders at Pyber visualize how fares differ by each city type on a weekly basis. 


## Results: 

After cleaning and making sense of our data, it is clear that ride sharing is more popular in Urban type cities, followed by Suburban then Rural.

Urban cities reached $39,854.38 in total Fares with 1625 rides getting an average of $24.53 per ride. Suburban cities reached $19,356.33 total fares with 625 rides and an average of $30.97 per ride. Rural cites reached $4,327.93 in total fares with 125 rides and an average of $34.62 per ride. The average fares per ride and driver are higher for Rural and Suburban cities than Urban because there are 30 times the amount of drivers than that of Rural cities and almost 5 times of Suburan citites at 2,405.
